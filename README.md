The program described is a disassembler(inverse disassembler) designed for 68000 assembly language. 
It works by converting a memory image of instructions and data back into readable assembly code, limited to using the 68000 processor 
simulator's text I/O functions. Upon starting, users are guided through the process of selecting the hexadecimal addresses of the code they wish to disassemble. 
The program then scans this memory region and displays the corresponding assembly instructions, handling them screen by screen. Special considerations, such as handling 
illegal instructions and displaying address displacements, are also part of the program's functionality, following the format: a- Memory location, b- Op-code, c- Operand.
